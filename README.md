## Third Data Structure Lecture

Welcome to the place where you find all the data structure and java EE source code with explanation comments.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies
- `src/datastructure`: the folder to maintain the class MyArray
- `src/App.java`: the main file



Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.
